EPR spectra of spin \u00bd centers have two contributions: the hyperfine tensor {\\bf A} {\\bf A} and the g-tensor {\\bf g} {\\bf g} , which are defined through the following effective Hamiltonian \\begin{equation} H_{eff}=\\frac{\\alpha}{2}{\\bf S}\\cdot{\\bf g}\\cdot{\\bf B} + \\sum_I {\\bf S}\\cdot{\\bf A}_{I}\\cdot{\\bf I}_I \\end{equation} where \\alpha \\alpha is the fine structure constant and the summation I I runs over nuclei. The hyperfine tensor arises from the interaction of the nuclei with the ground-state spin density. This term has been calculated within the planewave-pseudopotential approach; indeed it was for this property that the PAW scheme was first introduced.\\cite{walle93} The g-tensor arises from the interaction of the electronic spin with the external magnetic field. This term plays an somewhat similar role to the shielding in NMR; induced electronic currents in the sample modify the g-tensor from its vacuum value. The GIPAW approach has been used to compute g-tensors in several crystalline materials including defects in \\alpha \\alpha -quartz and zirconia.","title":"EPR Overview"},{"location":"documentation/Geometry_Optimisation/constraints/","text":"Atomic constraints CASTEP can impose various forms of linear or non-linear constraints upon the positions of the atoms. This can be used with all forms of geometry optimization and molecular dynamics. Some simple short cuts exist, such as to keep all the atoms fixed: FIX_ALL_IONS : T or to fix the Centre of Mass: FIX_COM : T It is also possible to specify constraints on individual atoms, using the IONIC_CONSTRAINTS block. The simplest case is to control which atoms remain fixed during a geometry optimisation. e.g. %BLOCK IONIC_CONSTRAINTS fix: C 1 !fix position of atom C 1 %ENDBLOCK IONIC_CONSTRAINTS Some further examples include fix: all !fix all atoms\u2028 fix: C N !fix species C and N\u2028 fix: C 1 !fix position of atom C 1\u2028 fix: C{1,3,5-10} !fix positions of atoms C1, C3, C5,C6,C7,C8,C9,C10\u2028 fix: all unfix: H !fix positions of all atoms except H The last example in particularly useful in the case of molecular crystals, when you might want to allow the H atoms to move but keep all of the heavy atoms in the positions determined by diffraction. To fix the individual Cartesian components of an atom's position use the full syntax of the ionic_constraints block, where each constraint removes one degree of freedom. For example %BLOCK IONIC_CONSTRAINTS 1 W 1 1.0000000000 0.0000000000 0.0000000000 2 W 1 0.0000000000 1.0000000000 0.0000000000 3 W 1 0.0000000000 0.0000000000 1.0000000000 4 W 2 1.0000000000 0.0000000000 0.0000000000 %ENDBLOCK IONIC_CONSTRAINTS The 1 st line says that constraint number 1 is to fix the x coordinate of Tungston atom 1. The 2 nd line says that constraint number 2 is to fix the y coordinate of Tungston atom 1. etc. To fix an atom in 3D requires 3 constraints to remove all 3 degrees of freedom. The ionic_constraints block can also be used to impose any arbitary linear constraint, such as to restrict an atom to move in a plane or along a line, or to fix the centre of mass. A constraint may involve more than 1 atom, and hence can span mulitple lines, but each constraint operates on 1 degree of freedom. It cannot be used to fix a bond length - that is a non-linear constraint - see below for more details. The general syntax for constraint i i operating on atom j j of element X at position r^j r^j is %BLOCK IONIC_CONSTRAINTS ... i X j a1 a2 a3 ... %ENDBLOCK IONIC_CONSTRAINTS and the constraint is specfied as \\begin{equation} C^i={\\bf a^i}\\cdot{\\bf r^j} \\end{equation} where C^i C^i is given by the initial conditions. For example to fix the second S atom to move in the plane parallel to y=x y=x use this: %BLOCK IONIC_CONSTRAINTS 1 S 2 -1 1 0 %ENDBLOCK IONIC_CONSTRAINTS Cell Constraints Cell constraints can be used with all forms of geometry optimization and molecular dynamics that all the cell size/shape to vary. Some simple short cuts exist, such as to keep the unit cell fixed during the optimisation FIX_CELL : T To fix the volume of the unit cell FIX_VOL : T It is also possible to apply an arbitary set of constraints to the cell angles and cell lengths using the CELL_CONSTRAINTS block. %BLOCK CELL_CONSTRAINTS a b c alpha beta gamma %ENDBLOCK CELL_CONSTRAINTS Setting an element to zero means to keep it fixed. Two or more elements set to the same positive integer, means that these elements should be kept equal during the geometry optimisation. For example %BLOCK CELL_CONSTRAINTS 0 0 0 4 5 6 %ENDBLOCK CELL_CONSTRAINTS would keep all cell lengths fixed, and allow the three cell angles to vary independently, and %BLOCK CELL_CONSTRAINTS 0 0 0 4 4 6 %ENDBLOCK CELL_CONSTRAINTS would enforce \\alpha=\\beta\\neq\\gamma \\alpha=\\beta\\neq\\gamma and keep the cell lengths fixed. Symmetry The application of symmetry with constraints (for ionic positions and/or cell vectors) needs to be considered carefully. In general, if symmetry is on, then there is no need to add a constraint to explicitly impose a restriction that is implied by the symmetry. If there is a need for an additional restriction, then that can be added on top of the symmetry, but the user needs to be careful that the additional constraint does not conflict with symmetry. If in doubt, turn symmetry off and impose all the desired constraints explicitly. Non-linear Constraints CASTEP can also support non-linear constraints, such as fixed bond length, in both molecular dynamics and geometry optimization if using GEOM_METHOD=DELOCALISED : %BLOCK NONLINEAR_CONSTRAINTS constraint_type atom1 atom2 (atom3 (atom 4)) ... %ENDBLOCK NONLINEAR_CONSTRAINTS where the first element specifies a constraint type (distance, bend or torsion). Then depending on the type of constraint, either 2, 3 or 4 atoms need to be specified. As for ionic constraints, atoms are specified by species and number within that species. In addition, it is necessary to specify which periodic image of the cell the atom is located in (so constraints can straddle a cell boundary). For instance %BLOCK NONLINEAR_CONSTRAINTS distance H 4 0 0 0 O 2 0 1 0 bend H 5 0 0 0 C 1 1 0 1 H 2 0 0 0 torsion H 6 0 0 0 H 3 1 0 0 H 1 0 0 1 H 9 1 1 1 0 %ENDBLOCK NONLINEAR_CONSTRAINTS specifies: the distance between the 4 th hydrogen atom and the 2 nd oxygen atom in the adjacent ( 0 1 0 ) cell the bend angle defined by the 5 th hydrogen atom, the 1 st carbon atom in the ( 1 0 1 ) cell and the 2 nd hydrogen atom the torsion angle defined by 4 hydrogen atoms, etc.","title":"Constraints"},{"location":"documentation/Geometry_Optimisation/constraints/#atomic-constraints","text":"CASTEP can impose various forms of linear or non-linear constraints upon the positions of the atoms.

The ionic positions are optimised using quasi-Newton methods. For each configuration of the ionic positions the electronic configuration is optimised using the method of conjugate gradients. The flow of the calculation is thus; Move ions into new positions using geometry optimisation algorithm Find electronic energy and forces for this ionic configuration Compare total energy with previous configurations and check if forces within tolerance limits If structure not optimised start at (1) and generate new set of ionic positions This cycle is performed until the forces fall within the tolerance limit and the energy should then be a local minimum. With periodic boundary conditions (as used by CASTEP) it is also possible to change the size and shape of the cell, in addition to (or instead of) moving the ions. In this case, the stress is calculated in addition to the forces, and this is used to change the cell, until the stress falls within a given tolerance. Finally, when considering the change in the cell, it is also possible to apply an external pressure. Hence it is the enthalpy, which is the appropriate free energy in this scenario, which is minimised instead of the energy. Finite-basis set corrections It should be noted, that with a plane-wave basis set (as used by CASTEP) there is an important side-effect of changing the size and/or shape of the cell - it changes the basis set used for the electronic states. Many DFT programs ignore this effect, which means that if the cell vectors change by more than a few %, the final structure is evaluated with a non-self-consistent basis, with a different cut-off energy to that intended. In CASTEP, there are two choices here: to either keep the cut-off energy constant (which results in the number and meaning of the plane-waves used in the basis changing from step-to-step) or to keep the number of plane-waves constant (which results in a change in the cut-off energy and in the meaning of the plane-waves used from step-to-step). The constant-cutoff/variable-number of plane-waves approach is the CASTEP default as it is the most physically reasonable. The constant number of plane-waves approach means that the quality of the calculation is changing from step-to-step. The effect of changing lattice vectors on the basis set can also be corrected to first-order using the 'finite basis set correction'. This can be calculated by the change in total energy for a small change in the cut-off energy at the start of a calculation, and then used as a correction to the energy and the stress. This is especially important in variable-cell calculations, for which it is activated by default. Advanced settings For geometry optimisation, there are a variety of different algorithms available which can be selected by the geom_method parameter in the param file. The choices are: LBFGS - the low-memory version of BFGS - the default option BFGS - widely-used quasi-Newton minimization TPSD - two-point steepest descent DELOCALIZED - a BFGS-based minimizer using delocalized internal coordinates DMD - optimally damped MD FIRE - fast inertial relaxation engine - a modified MD approach NB These are all 'local optimisations', i.e. the final structure depends upon the initial configuration and is not the global minimum. For those interested in finding the global minimum, then there are associated projects using Genetic Algorithms and AIRSS. The first 3 methods can do variable-cell or fixed-cell optimization, whereas the last 3 are only fixed-cell (for now). LBFGS/BFGS is generally the fastest method, and since v19, LBFGS has supported new preconditioners which should make it generally faster still. TPSD (unlike LBFGS/BFGS) has no built-in history, so should be much slower - however, the CASTEP implementation has a very efficient preconditioner which makes up for this, and the lack of history means that variable-cell optimisation with additional cell constraints is much more efficient than the equivalent calculation in LBFGS/BFGS. The DELOCALIZED minimizer is the only supported method to use delocalized internal coordinates, as opposed to absolute or fractional coordinates, and as such, should be best for optimizing large structures such as molecule-in-a-box with many low-energy soft modes. The two MD-based methods are generally less efficient, but can handle arbitrary constraints well, and have sometimes out-performed other methods for very anisotropic systems, such as molecule-on-a-surface etc.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"documentation/Geometry_Optimisation/overview/#finite-basis-set-corrections","text":"It should be noted, that with a plane-wave basis set (as used by CASTEP) there is an important side-effect of changing the size and/or shape of the cell - it changes the basis set used for the electronic states.

See the full cell file page for more details. The cell file is one of CASTEP's two main input files. It contains all of the information about the crystal lattice and the atomic positions, as well as additional information such as Brillouin zone sampling ('k-points'), pseudopotentials, and atomic properties. The file itself is a free-format keyword-driven text file, consisting of keywords and blocks of information. These may be given in any order, with blocks indicated by the special %block and %endblock markers. Most of the keywords and blocks are optional, but CASTEP requires two block entries: a block to specify the lattice, and another to specify the atomic elements and positions within the cell. Lattice There are two main ways to set the crystal lattice in the cell file. The lattice_abc block specifies the lattice constants in terms of the lengths of the lattice vectors ( \\mathbf{a} \\mathbf{a} , \\mathbf{b} \\mathbf{b} and \\mathbf{c} \\mathbf{c} ) and angles (alpha, beta and gamma): %block lattice_abc a b c alpha beta gamma %endblock lattice_abc This doesn't specify how the cell is to be oriented in the Cartesian coordinate system, so CASTEP uses the convention that \\mathbf{a} \\mathbf{a} is along the x-axis, and \\mathbf{b} \\mathbf{b} is in the x-y plane. Alternatively, you can specify the lattice vectors \\mathbf{a} \\mathbf{a} , \\mathbf{b} \\mathbf{b} and \\mathbf{c} \\mathbf{c} directly in terms of their Cartesian components, using the lattice_cart block. Note that these are specified as row vectors: %block lattice_cart [unit] a_x a_y a_z b_x b_y b_z c_x c_y c_z %endblock lattice_cart The first line is optional, and specifies a length unit; the default is ang , meaning Angstroms. Atomic positions The positions of the atoms within a cell may be specified in either fractional coordinates (i.e. the coordinates in the basis of the lattice vectors) or Cartesian coordinates: %block positions_frac symbol u v w %endblock positions_frac where symbol is the chemical symbol for the atomic element, and u , v and w are the fractional components of the lattice vectors \\mathbf{a} \\mathbf{a} , \\mathbf{b} \\mathbf{b} and \\mathbf{c} \\mathbf{c} , respectively, such that the Cartesian positions vector of the atom, \\mathbf{r} \\mathbf{r} , is \\mathbf{r} = u\\mathbf{a} + v\\mathbf{b} + w\\mathbf{c} \\mathbf{r} = u\\mathbf{a} + v\\mathbf{b} + w\\mathbf{c} To add a second atom, simply add a second line with the new information, and similarly for additional atoms. An alternative is to specify the atomic coordinates with reference to their absolute Cartesian coordinates: %block positions_abs [unit] symbol x y z %endblock positions_abs where [unit] is an optional length unit (default: ang , meaning Angstroms), symbol is the chemical symbol for the atomic element, and x , y and z are the Cartesian coordinates of the atom, such that the position vector, \\mathbf{r}=(x,y,z) \\mathbf{r}=(x,y,z) .

Higher values mean more plane-waves and a better representation of the wavefunction, but this consumes more computer RAM and the calculation will take more time.

Including such dispersion effects is essential for accurately describing certain systems, especially for systems that are not bound ionically or covalently, e.g. gas molecules. The use of a dispersion method is strongly recommended when intermolecular interactions are expected to play a key role such as in molecular crystals, stacked 2D materials, and generally any weakly-bound system. Types of correction schemes There are several families of dispersion methods. A good summary of these can be found in the 2016 review by Grimme et al. We will summarise these categories here and, for those implemented in CASTEP, link to the relevant keywords. Semiempirical/semiclassical treatments Here the dispersion energy is calculated atom-wise (typically pair-wise) and is added to the DFT energy of the underlying functional. Note that a specific damping parameter (and function) is usually used to combine a given underlying functional (e.g. PBE) with a dispersion correction (e.g. D3). This means, for example, that the D3 correction to the PBE functional may be different to the D3 correction to HSE. Methods include: The Tkatchenko\u2212Scheffler scheme ( TS ) The TS-based many-body dispersion scheme ( MBD ) Grimme's D2 and D3 methods The exchange-dipole moment model ( XDM ) Nonlocal density-based treatments (not implemented in CASTEP) Here non-local functionals of the electronic density are constructed. Methods include the van der Waals functionals (e.g. vdW-DF2 and vdW-DF-cx ) and Vydrov and Van Voorhis functionals (e.g. VV10 ). Effective one-electron potentials (not implemented in CASTEP) Finally, the many-body correlated motion of electrons can be, to some extent, captured empiricially by using effective one-electron potentials. Examples of these include: semi-local functionals such as the Minnesota functionals (e.g. M06 ) and external potentials such as the dispersion-corrected atom-centered potentials (see e.g. van Santen 2015 ). General recommendations TODO -- check these Every application will have its own set of important features and it is not possible to say with certainty which density functional approximation will be the most appropriate. With that said, here are some suggestions for different types of materials: Molecular crystals: D3/D3-BJ/XDM/MBD in combination with GGA or hybrid functionals ( Dolgonos et al. 2019 ). Metals: vdW-DFs developed with solid state materials in mind (see e.g. Klime\u0161 et al. 2011 ). TODO: what about methods available in CASTEP? Interactions between molecules and surfaces of metals: vdW-DFs or dispersion methods that include screening, e.g. TSSCS MOFs: dispersion corrected (e.g. TS, D3, etc.) GGAs Layered vdW materials: Beyond pairwise appraches, e.g. D3 ^* ^* or MBD. TODO: others? ^* ^* See note below for how to include the three-body terms in the CASTEP D3 correction. Again, please do your own testing and consult relevant reviews and benchmarking papers. For the TS, MBD and XDM methods you may get a warning if your unit cell is small (where the lattice constants are comparable to the vdW radii). In such cases, try to use larger unit cells until your dispersion correction converges. TODO: any other solutions? Not all XC_FUNCTIONAL values are supported for all schemes - if in doubt use PBE. Each scheme has default parameters defined for a subset of elements (see table below). For other elements you need to define custom parameters using the SEDC_CUSTOM_PARAMS keyword in the .cell file. Using dispersion corrections in CASTEP .param file keywords In the .param file, set: SEDC_APPLY : true turns on dispersion correction.

See the basic cell file page for an overview. This page has the most frequently-used cell file options, but for a full set use CASTEP's built-in help . There is also a concise table of cell keywords . The cell file is one of CASTEP's two main input files. It contains all of the information about the crystal lattice and the atomic positions, as well as additional information such as Brillouin zone sampling ('k-points'), pseudopotentials, cell symmetry, external pressure, constraints on motion of the atoms or cell, and atomic properties such as the mass of each species. The file itself is a free-format keyword-driven text file, consisting of keywords and blocks of information. These may be given in any order, with blocks indicated by the special %block and %endblock markers. Most of the keywords and blocks are optional, but CASTEP requires two block entries: a block to specify the lattice, and another to specify the atomic elements and positions within the cell. At the very least, the cell lattice vectors and ionic positions must be specified. Reasonable defaults are chosen for anything else not specified. For the purposes of the following definitions, all variables represented by R R are defined to be real numbers, those represented by I I are defined to be integers and those represented by C C are characters. Cell Lattice Vectors The cell lattice vectors may be specified in Cartesian coordinates or in terms of the lattice vector magnitudes and the angles between them ( a, b, c, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma a, b, c, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma ). Only one of LATTICE_CART and LATTICE_ABC may occur in a cell definition file. The definitions of these keywords are as follows: %BLOCK LATTICE_CART [units] a_x a_y a_z b_x b_y b_z c_x c_y c_z %ENDBLOCK LATTICE_CART Here a_x is the x-component of the first lattice vector, \\mathbf{a} \\mathbf{a} , b_y b_y is the y-component of the second lattice vector, \\mathbf{b} \\mathbf{b} , etc. [units] specifies the units in which the lattice vectors are defined. If not present, the default is \u00c5. %BLOCK LATTICE_ABC [units] a b c alpha beta gamma %ENDBLOCK LATTICE_ABC Here a is the value of the lattice constant \\vert\\mathbf{a}\\vert \\vert\\mathbf{a}\\vert , gamma is the value of the cell angle \\gamma \\gamma (in degrees) etc. If the lattice is specified in this manner, the absolute orientation is arbitrary. In this case the orientation is defined by applying the following constraints: \\mathbf{a} \\mathbf{a} lies along the x-axis \\mathbf{b} \\mathbf{b} lies in the xy plane \\mathbf{c} \\mathbf{c} forms a right-handed set with \\mathbf{a} \\mathbf{a} and \\mathbf{b} \\mathbf{b} [units] specifies the units in which the lattice vector magnitudes are defined. If not present, the default is \u00c5. Angles should be specified in degrees. Ionic Positions The ionic positions may be specified in fractional coordinates relative to the lattice vectors of the unit cell, or in absolute coordinates. Only one of POSITIONS_FRAC and POSITIONS_ABS may occur in a cell definition file. %BLOCK POSITIONS_FRAC CCC_1 R_{1i} R_{1j} R_{1k} [SPIN=s_1] CCC_2 R_{2i} R_{2j} R_{2k} [SPIN=s_2] ... %ENDBLOCK END POSITIONS_FRAC The first entry on a line is the symbol of the species (chemical element). Alternatively, the atomic number may be given instead, in which case CASTEP will be look up for chemical symbol. A symbol can have a maximum of three characters. The first alphabetical characters identify the element, from which default values for atomic mass etc. The next three entries on a line in POSITIONS_FRAC are real numbers representing the position of the ion in fractions of the unit cell lattice vectors. If the optional flag SPIN is present on a line, this sets the spin polarisation ( N^\\uparrow-N^\\downarrow N^\\uparrow-N^\\downarrow ) of the atom for initialisation of the spin density; for non-collinear spin calculations, the vector spin is specified as three numbers. If this flag is not present a non-spin polarised state will be assumed. %BLOCK POSITIONS_ABS [units] CCC_1 R_{1i} R_{1j} R_{1k} [SPIN=s_1] CCC_2 R_{2i} R_{2j} R_{2k} [SPIN=s_2] ... %ENDBLOCK POSITIONS_ABS The first entry on a line is the symbol or atomic number of the ionic species, as for POSITIONS_FRAC . The next three entries are real numbers representing the position of the ion in Cartesian coordinates. [units] specifies the units in which the positions are defined. If not present, the default is \u00c5. The optional flag SPIN is defined above under POSITIONS_FRAC . Brillouin Zone Sampling (k-points) (N.B. in the following section the keywords with the prefixes KPOINT_ and KPOINTS_ are synonymous. KPOINT_ is the preferred usage.) The k-points at which the Brillouin zone is to be sampled during a self consistent calculation to find the electronic ground state may be defined either by specifying a list of k-points or a Monkhorst-Pack grid in terms of the dimensions of the k-point mesh or a minimum k-point density. The origin of the Monkhorst-Pack grid may be offset by a vector from the origin of the Brillouin zone. If no k-points are specified, the default will be a Monkhorst-Pack grid with a maximum spacing of 0.1\u00c5 ^{-1} ^{-1} and no offset of the origin. The KPOINT_LIST , KPOINT_MP_GRID and KPOINT_MP_SPACING keywords are mutually exclusive. KPOINT_MP_OFFSET may be specified in combination with either KPOINT_MP_GRID or KPOINT_MP_SPACING . %BLOCK KPOINT_LIST \\begin{array}{cccc} R_{1i} R_{1j} R_{1k} R_{1w} R_{2i} R_{2j} R_{2k} R_{2w} ... %ENDBLOCK KPOINT_LIST The first three entries on a line are the fractional positions of the k-point relative to the reciprocal space lattice vectors. The final entry on a line is the weight of the k-point relative to the others specified. The sum of the weights must be equal to 1. KPOINT_MP_GRID I_i I_j I_k This specifies the dimensions of the Monkhorst-Pack grid requested in the directions of the reciprocal space lattice vectors. The generated grid will be I_i\\times I_j\\times I_k I_i\\times I_j\\times I_k ; any symmetries generated (or supplied) will be used to reduce this number, when computing the irreducible wedge. KPOINT_MP_SPACING R [units] The single entry is the maximum distance between k-points on the Monkhorst-Pack grid. The dimensions of the grid will be chosen such that the maximum separation of k-points is less than this. [units] specifies the units in which the k-point spacing is defined, although note that the actual units used are 2\\pi 2\\pi units . If not present, the default is ang-1 , such that the spacing is in 2\\pi \u00c5^{-1} 2\\pi \u00c5^{-1} . KPOINT_MP_OFFSET R_i R_j R_k This specifies the offset of the Monkhorst-Pack grid with respect to the origin of the Brillouin zone. The three entries are the offset in fractional coordinates relative to the reciprocal lattice vectors. The k-point set for performing spectral calculations can be specified in the same manner, using version of the keywords above with SPECTRAL_ prepended. The same restrictions regarding mutually exclusive keywords apply. For a non-self-consistent spectral calculation, the k-points may be defined along a path through reciprocal space or a list of k-points. %BLOCK SPECTRAL_KPOINT_PATH R_{1i} R_{1j} R_{1k} R_{2i} R_{2j} R_{2k} ... %ENDBLOCK SPECTRAL_KPOINT_PATH The three numbers on each line are the fractional positions of the k-point relative to the reciprocal space lattice vectors. The k-points define a continuous sequence of straight line segments, unless the keyword BREAK appears on a separate line within the sequence of k-points. In this case the continuous path will end at the k-point immediately preceding the BREAK keyword and resume at the k-point immediately following. The path will be open unless the first and last point in the list are identical . The maximum spacing of the points sampled along each line segment is defined by the keyword SPECTRAL_KPOINT_PATH_SPACING (default value 0.1 \\times 2\\pi 0.1 \\times 2\\pi \u00c5 ^{-1} ^{-1} ). If necessary, the actual spacing used may be smaller than this in order to ensure that the length of the line segment is an integer multiple of the spacing between points on that segment. Alternatively, the k-point set for performing a band structure calculation can be specified in the same manner as the main k-point set, using version of the keywords above with BS_ prepended. The same restrictions regarding mutually exclusive keywords apply. In this case, the k-point weight in SPECTRAL_KPOINT_LIST is optional. If omitted, the weights for each k-point are assumed to be equal. For a phonon spectrum calculation, the k-points may be defined along a path through reciprocal space or a list of k-points, in the same manner as for a spectral calculation. The corresponding keywords are identical to those for the band structure specification with the initial SPECTRAL_ replaced by PHONON_ , e.g. PHONON_KPOINT_PATH , PHONON_KPOINT_PATH_SPACING and PHONON_KPOINT_LIST . The same restrictions regarding mutually exclusive keywords apply. The block keyword PHONON_GAMMA_DIRECTIONS specifies the directions in which the gamma point will be approached when calculating the non-analytic terms of the LO/TO splitting. Each line in this block will consist of a 3-vector specifying a direction in the basis of reciprocal lattice vectors. If this keyword is not present, the default will be a single vector determined as follows: If the gamma point is q_i = 0 q_i = 0 and there is a successor kpoint q_{i+1} q_{i+1} in the list, then it is q_{i+1} q_{i+1} . Otherwise if the gamma point is q_i =0 q_i =0 and there is a predecessor kpoint q_{i-1} q_{i-1} in the list then it is q_{i-1} q_{i-1} . Otherwise (i.e. a Gamma point only calculation) the a-axis of the reciprocal cell. For backwards compatibility the keywords beginning BS_ and OPTICS_ are synonyms for SPECTRAL_KPOINT_ and similarly those beginning. Cell Symmetry If no symmetry is specified in the cell definition file, the default is for no symmetry to be applied. SYMMETRY_GENERATE If this keyword is present in the cell, the highest symmetry group that applies to the structure of the cell will be found and the corresponding symmetry operations generated. SYMMETRY_TOL R [units] This parameter is the tolerance within which symmetry will be considered to be satisfied. If an ion is found within this distance of its symmetric position, the symmetry will be considered to be satisfied. [units] specifies the units in which the tolerance is defined. If not present, the default is \u00c5. Alternatively, the symmetry operations may be provided directly in a SYMMETRY_OPS block. The symmetry of the cell is represented as a series of symmetry operations under which the unit cell is invariant. Each operation is represented as a 3\\times 3 3\\times 3 array. %BLOCK SYMMETRY_OPS R_{11} R_{21} R_{31} R_{12} R_{22} R_{32} R_{13} R_{23} R_{33} T_1 T_2 T_3 R_{11} R_{21} R_{31} R_{12} R_{22} R_{32} R_{13} R_{23} R_{33} T_1 T_2 T_3 ... %ENDBLOCK SYMMETRY_OPS Each of the first three lines contains 3 entries representing a row of a 3\\times3 3\\times3 array. These represent one symmetry rotation. The three entries on the following line contain the translation associated with this rotation. Constraints The movement of ions or the unit cell during a relaxation or molecular dynamics run may be constrained. The constraints on the ionic motion may by specified as a set of linear constraints. Each constraint is specified as a series of coefficients a_{ijk} a_{ijk} such that: $$ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\tt N_\\mathrm{species}} \\quad \\sum_{j=1}^{\\mathrm{N_\\mathrm{ions}}(k)} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{ijk} \\verb#ionic_positions(i,j,k)# = constant $$ where \\mathrm{N_\\mathrm{ions}}(k) \\mathrm{N_\\mathrm{ions}}(k) is the number of ions in species k k . The change in the shape of the unit cell may also be constrained using the keyword CELL_CONSTRAINTS . The special case of constraining the centre of mass of the ions to remain fixed is supported by a logical keyword FIX_COM . Also all ionic positions or cell parameters may be fixed by specifying the keywords FIX_ALL_IONS or FIX_ALL_CELL to be TRUE respectively. If no ionic or cell constraints are specified in the cell definition file, the default is to fix the centre of mass. %BLOCK IONIC_CONSTRAINTS I_1 CCC_{1s} I_{1s} I_{n1} R_{1i} R_{1j} R_{1k} I_2 CCC_{2s} I_{2s} I_{n2} R_{2i} R_{2j} R_{2k} ... %ENDBLOCK IONIC_CONSTRAINTS The first element on each line is an integer specifying the number of the constraint being specified. The second entry is either the symbol or atomic number of the species of the ion to which this constraint applies. The third element is the number of the ion within the species. The ordering of the ions in a species is the order in which they appear in the POSITIONS_FRAC or POSITIONS_ABS block in the cell definition file. The final three numbers are real numbers representing the coefficients of the Cartesian coordinates of the ionic position in the constraint sum. All coefficients in the sum not explicitly specified will be zero. On reading this data, the matrix of ionic constraints will be orthogonalised. %BLOCK CELL_CONSTRAINTS I_a I_b I_c I_alpha I_beta I_gamma %ENDBLOCK CELL_CONSTRAINTS The first three entries relate to the magnitude of the three lattice vectors a,b,c a,b,c and the second set of three entries to the angles \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma . If the value of the entry corresponding to a magnitude or angle is zero, this quantity will remain fixed. If two or three entries contain the same integer, the corresponding quantities will be constrained to have the same value. If a positive integer greater than 0 occurs in entries 1 through 3 the same integer cannot occur in entries 4 through 6 as this would imply that a vector length and angle must have the same value. Species Characteristics The mass of a species, the pseudopotential which represents the ion and the size of the LCAO basis set used for population anslsyis may be specified in the cell definition file. %BLOCK SPECIES_MASS [units] CCC_1 I_1 R_1 CCC_2 I_2 R_2 ... %ENDBLOCK SPECIES_MASS [units] specifies the units in which the masses are defined. If not present, the default is atomic mass units. The first entry on a line is the symbol or atomic number of the species. This must correspond with the species symbol or atomic number of the species in the POSITIONS_FRAC or POSITIONS_ABS block. The second entry on each line is the mass of that species. Not all species need appear in the SPECIES_MASS block, any not present will assume the default mass for that species. If the initial alphabetical symbol specified for a species is not a standard element symbol in the periodic table, the mass of the species must be specified. %BLOCK SPECIES_POT CCC_1 I_1 <filename> CCC_2 I_2 <filename> ... %ENDBLOCK SPECIES_POT The first entry on a line is the symbol or atomic number of the species. This must correspond with the species symbol or atomic number of the species in the POSITIONS_FRAC or POSITIONS_ABS block. The second entry on each line is the filename of the file containing the definition of the pseudopotential representing the ionic species. The file to which this refers may be a definition of the parameters of the pseudopotential which is to be generated at runtime, or an old-style pseudopotential definition containing the data for the pseudopotential. Not all species need appear in the SPECIES_POT block. If a pseudopotential is not specified, the default pseudopotential parameters will be used to generate a pseudopotential for the element specified. If the initial alphabetical characters of a species label is not a standard element symbol in the periodic table, the potential for the species must be specified. The charge on the ion for each species will be derived from the pseudopotential corresponding to that ion. %BLOCK SPECIES_LCAO_STATES CCC_1 I_1 I_{B1} CCC_2 I_2 I_{B2} ... %ENDBLOCK SPECIES_LCAO_STATES The first entry on a line is the symbol or atomic number of the species. This must correspond with the species symbol or atomic number of the species in the POSITIONS_FRAC or POSITIONS_ABS block. The second number is the number of angular momentum channels to use in the LCAO basis set for the species when performing population analysis. For example, to use the 2s and 2p states for C (The 1s state is a core state) this should be 2. By default, the number of states will be the appropriate number to complete the valence shell to the next noble gas. If shallow core states are excluded from a pseudopotential, the value of SPECIES_LCAO_STATES for that species should be included in the cell file to ensure a meaningful basis set is used. External Pressure An external pressure may be applied to the unit cell by specifying a pressure tensor. %BLOCK EXTERNAL_PRESSURE [units] R_{xx} R_{xy} R_{xz} R_{yy} R_{yz} R_{zz} %ENDBLOCK EXTERNAL_PRESSURE [units] specifies the units in which the pressure is defined. If not present, the default is GPa. Entry R_{xx} R_{xx} is the xx xx -component of the pressure, R_{xy} R_{xy} the xy xy -component etc. The default is to apply no external pressure. Ionic Velocities The initial ionic velocities may be specified in Cartesian coordinates in a cell definition file. %BLOCK IONIC_VELOCITIES [units] CCC_1 V_{1x} V_{1y} V_{1z} CCC_2 V_{2x} V_{2y} V_{2z} ... %ENDBLOCK IONIC_VELOCITIES The first entry on a line is the chemical symbol (or atomic number) of the ionic species. The correct symbol will be looked up for the atomic species if the atomic number is specified. A symbol can have a maximum of three characters. The next three entries are real numbers representing the velocity of the ion in Cartesian coordinates. [units] specifies the units in which the positions are defined. If not present, the default is \u00c5/ps. If this keyword is not present and a molecular dynamics calculation is performed, the ionic velocities will be randomly initialised with the appropriate temperature.","title":"cell file"},{"location":"documentation/Input_Files/cell_file/#cell-lattice-vectors","text":"The cell lattice vectors may be specified in Cartesian coordinates or in terms of the lattice vector magnitudes and the angles between them ( a, b, c, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma a, b, c, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma ).

See the basic param file page for an overview. This page has the most frequently-used param file options, but for a full set use CASTEP's built-in help . The param file is one of CASTEP's two main input files. It contains all of the information about the kind of simulation your wish CASTEP to perform, as well as details of how CASTEP should perform them and additional simulations and analyses. The file itself is a free-format keyword-driven text file, consisting largely of single-line keywords, although there are a small number of blocks of information. These may be given in any order, with blocks indicated by the special %block and %endblock markers. All of the keywords and blocks are optional, but you will almost always want to change at least some. Task This keyword controls what CASTEP's simulation task is. The default is task : energy which tells CASTEP to compute the ground state electronic energy and density for the input set of atoms from the cell file . Cut-off energy The plane-wave cut-off energy controls how large CASTEP's basis set is for representing the wavefunction. Higher values mean more plane-waves and a better representation of the wavefunction, but this consumes more computer RAM and the calculation will take more time. CASTEP calculations are always a compromise between the accuracy you require, and the computational resources the simulations will use. The cut-off energy you need will also depend on the pseudopotentials you're using in the cell file . You can choose from some preset values using the basis_precision keyword: basis_precision : coarse|medium|fine|precise i.e. you can choose to set basis_precision to coarse , medium , fine or precise . The settings coarse and medium are usually only suitable for quick preliminary investigations, and for research simulations you will usually want to set it to fine or better. For more control over the cut-off energy, the cut_off_energy keyword may be used instead: cut_off_energy : 500 eV Typical cut-off energies are in the range 300 to 1500 eV. XC functional Density functional theory is exact in principle, except for the exchange-correlation (XC) functional which must be approximated. There are many different functional forms to approximate this, and in CASTEP you select it with the xc_functional keyword, for example: xc_functional : pbe which selects the PBE functional of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof.","title":"param file"},{"location":"documentation/Input_Files/param_file/#task","text":"This keyword controls what CASTEP's simulation task is.

To perform this kind of calculation, set task : MD in your param file. CASTEP has a wide range of Molecular Dynamics (MD) capabilities, and can do equilibrium MD using a variety of ensembles: * NVE - the microcanonical ensemble - with fixed number of atoms, volume of cell, and total energy conserved * NVT - the canonical ensemble - with constant temperature not constant energy - due to the application of a thermostat * NPH - constant external pressure and enthalpy - due to the application of a barostat * NPT - constant external pressure and temperature - due to the application of a barostat and a thermostat Of thse, NPT is the closest to most real-life experiments. Of the different thermostats, CASTEP supports Nose-Hoover, Nose-Hoover chains, Langevin and Hoover-Langevin. Of the different barostats, CASTEP supports the isotropic Andersen-Hoover barostat, and the anisotropic Parrinello-Rahman barostat. CASTEP also supports the Berendsen thermostat and barostat, as a route to faster equilibration before switching to one of the above thermostats/barostats for production data. CASTEP can also go beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to do quantum dynamics, using Path Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD), in either NVT or NPT ensembles. In all MD schemes, CASTEP can support both linear and non-linear constraints on the ionic positions and/or on the cell vectors.

Magnetic Shielding In a diamagnetic insulator this arises from orbital currents induced by an external magnetic field. This current {\\bf j}({\\bf r}) {\\bf j}({\\bf r}) , produces a non-uniform induced magnetic field in the material, which is given by the Biot-Savart law as {\\bf B}_{\\rm in}({\\bf r}) =\\frac{1}{c}\\int d^3r' {\\bf j}({\\bf r}')\\times \\frac{{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'}{|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'|^3}. {\\bf B}_{\\rm in}({\\bf r}) =\\frac{1}{c}\\int d^3r' {\\bf j}({\\bf r}')\\times \\frac{{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'}{|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'|^3}.

It can thus be seen that the question of computing the shielding tensor is that of computing the induced electronic current. J-coupling The J-coupling is a small perturbation to the electronic ground-state of the system and we can identify it as a derivative of the total energy E, of the system {\\bf J}_{\\rm KL}= \\frac{\\hbar\\gamma_{\\rm K}\\gamma_{\\rm L}}{2\\pi}\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial {\\bf m}_{\\rm K} \\partial {\\bf m}_{\\rm L}} {\\bf J}_{\\rm KL}= \\frac{\\hbar\\gamma_{\\rm K}\\gamma_{\\rm L}}{2\\pi}\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial {\\bf m}_{\\rm K} \\partial {\\bf m}_{\\rm L}} An equivalent expression arises from considering one nuclear spin (L) as perturbation which creates a magnetic field at a second (receiving) nucleus (K) {\\bf B}^{(1)}_{\\rm in}({\\bf R}_{{\\rm K}}) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar\\gamma_{{\\rm K}}\\gamma_{{\\rm L}}}{\\bf J}_{{\\rm KL}} \\cdot {\\bf m}_{{\\rm L}}. {\\bf B}^{(1)}_{\\rm in}({\\bf R}_{{\\rm K}}) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar\\gamma_{{\\rm K}}\\gamma_{{\\rm L}}}{\\bf J}_{{\\rm KL}} \\cdot {\\bf m}_{{\\rm L}}. Eqn.~\\ref{eq:J} tells us that the question of computing J is essentially that of computing the magnetic field induced indirectly by a nuclear magnetic moment. When spin-orbit coupling is neglected we can consider the field as arising from two, essentially independent, mechanisms. Firstly, the magnetic moment can interact with electronic charge inducing an orbital current {\\bf j}({\\bf r}) {\\bf j}({\\bf r}) , which in turn creates a magnetic field at the other nuclei in the system. This mechanism is similar to the case of magnetic shielding in insulators. The second mechanism arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment with the electronic spin, causing an electronic spin polarisation. By working to first order in these quantities we can write the magnetic field at atom {\\rm K} {\\rm K} induced by the magnetic moment of atom {\\rm L} {\\rm L} as {\\bf B}^{(1)}_{\\rm in}({\\bf R}_{{\\rm K}}) = \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\int {\\bf m}^{(1)}({\\bf r})\\cdot \\left[\\frac{3{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}} - |{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}|^{2}}{|{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}|^{5}}\\right]\\,{\\rm d}^{3}{\\bf r} {\\bf B}^{(1)}_{\\rm in}({\\bf R}_{{\\rm K}}) = \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\int {\\bf m}^{(1)}({\\bf r})\\cdot \\left[\\frac{3{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}} - |{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}|^{2}}{|{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}|^{5}}\\right]\\,{\\rm d}^{3}{\\bf r} + \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\frac{8\\pi}{3}\\int {\\bf m}^{(1)}({\\bf r}) \\delta({\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}})\\,{\\rm d}^{3}{\\bf r} + \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\frac{8\\pi}{3}\\int {\\bf m}^{(1)}({\\bf r}) \\delta({\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}})\\,{\\rm d}^{3}{\\bf r} + \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\int {\\bf j}^{(1)}({\\bf r})\\times \\frac{{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}}{|{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}|^{3}}\\,{\\rm d}^{3}{\\bf r}. + \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\int {\\bf j}^{(1)}({\\bf r})\\times \\frac{{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}}{|{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}|^{3}}\\,{\\rm d}^{3}{\\bf r}. Several quantum chemistry packages provide the ability to compute J coupling tensors in molecular systems (see Ref 1 } for a review of methods). An approach to compute J tensors within the planewave-pseudopotential approach has recently been developed. 2 EFG For a nucleus with spin > > \u00bd the NMR response will include an interaction between the quadrupole moment of the nucleus, Q, and the electric field gradient (EFG) generated by the surrounding electronic structure.

The LAPW approach in its implementation within the Wien series of codes\\cite{blaha90} has been widely used and shown to reliably predict Electric Field Gradient (EFG) tensors 3 .

Eqn.~\\ref{eq:J} tells us that the question of computing J is essentially that of computing the magnetic field induced indirectly by a nuclear magnetic moment. When spin-orbit coupling is neglected we can consider the field as arising from two, essentially independent, mechanisms. Firstly, the magnetic moment can interact with electronic charge inducing an orbital current {\\bf j}({\\bf r}) {\\bf j}({\\bf r}) , which in turn creates a magnetic field at the other nuclei in the system. This mechanism is similar to the case of magnetic shielding in insulators. The second mechanism arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment with the electronic spin, causing an electronic spin polarisation. By working to first order in these quantities we can write the magnetic field at atom {\\rm K} {\\rm K} induced by the magnetic moment of atom {\\rm L} {\\rm L} as {\\bf B}^{(1)}_{\\rm in}({\\bf R}_{{\\rm K}}) = \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\int {\\bf m}^{(1)}({\\bf r})\\cdot \\left[\\frac{3{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}} - |{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}|^{2}}{|{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}|^{5}}\\right]\\,{\\rm d}^{3}{\\bf r} {\\bf B}^{(1)}_{\\rm in}({\\bf R}_{{\\rm K}}) = \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\int {\\bf m}^{(1)}({\\bf r})\\cdot \\left[\\frac{3{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}} - |{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}|^{2}}{|{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}|^{5}}\\right]\\,{\\rm d}^{3}{\\bf r} + \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\frac{8\\pi}{3}\\int {\\bf m}^{(1)}({\\bf r}) \\delta({\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}})\\,{\\rm d}^{3}{\\bf r} + \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\frac{8\\pi}{3}\\int {\\bf m}^{(1)}({\\bf r}) \\delta({\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}})\\,{\\rm d}^{3}{\\bf r} + \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\int {\\bf j}^{(1)}({\\bf r})\\times \\frac{{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}}{|{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}|^{3}}\\,{\\rm d}^{3}{\\bf r}. + \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\int {\\bf j}^{(1)}({\\bf r})\\times \\frac{{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}}{|{\\bf r}_{{\\rm K}}|^{3}}\\,{\\rm d}^{3}{\\bf r}.

For Carbon these are the 2s and 2p states. Their occupations and energies are given. Pseudopotential Definition (Advanced) The definitions of each of the non-local projector (aka beta projectors) is given here. Beta - the number of the projector l - angular momentum quantum number e - energy of the corresponding orbital Rc - Cutoff (matching) radius for the orbital scheme - pseudization scheme (qc = qc tuned) norm - 1=norm-conserving 0-ultrasoft (norm not conserved) This is a standard Ultrasoft pseudopotential with two beta projectors per angular momentum channel. One projector is from an orbital at the eigen-energy (i.e. -0.505Ha for 2s) while the second projector corresponds to a non-bound orbital at an energy of 0.25Ha. The final line gives the choice of local potential. In this case the local potential is constructed from a l=2 state with the same cutoff radius as for the local projectors. Augmentation charge Rinner . This is specific to the Ultrasoft scheme - and describes the radius outside which the augmentation charge matches the all-electron charge. Partial core correction . As the exchange correlation energy is a non-linear function of charge there is an error introduced if we compute the xc energy of the valence and core electron separately. We therefore include the core charge in the calculation of the xc energy. The core charge is challenging to represent on a grid - and so a pseudized core charge is used. Rc is the cut-off for this pseudized core charge.

The core electrons are tightly bound to the nucleus, while the valence electrons are more extended. A working definition for core electrons is that they are the ones which play no part in the interactions between atoms, while the valence electrons dictate most of the properties of the material. It is common to make the frozen core approximation; the core electrons are constrained not to differ from their free atomic nature when placed in the solid state environment. This reduces the number of electronic degrees of freedom in an all-electron calculation. It is a very good approximation. A different, but physically related, approach is taken in the pseudopotential approximation. Since, in an all-electron calculation, the valence electron wavefunctions must be orthogonal to the core wavefunctions they necessarily have strong oscillations in the region near the nucleus (see the all-electron wavefunction in Figure~\\ref{fig:wvfn}). Given that a planewave basis set is to be used to describe the wavefunctions, these strong oscillations are undesirable --- requiring many plane waves for an accurate description. Further, these oscillations are of very little consequence for the electronic structure in the solid, since they occur close to the nucleus. In the pseudopotential approach only the valence electrons are explicitly considered, the effects of the core electrons being integrated within a new ionic potential. The valence wavefunctions need no longer be orthogonal to the core states, and so the orthogonality oscillations disappear; hence far fewer plane waves are required to describe the valence wavefunctions. Numerous schemes to produce optimally soft pseudopotentials have been developed. Common choices are the norm-conserving potentials due to Troullier and Martins\\cite{troullier91} and Vanderbilt's ultrasoft scheme.\\cite{vanderbilt90}","title":"Theory"},{"location":"documentation/Spectral/keywords/","text":"SPECTRAL_TASK - determines what will be calculated.

For example to use the PBE functional in the .param file simply use xc_functional : PBE There are a number of standard functionals that can be used in Castep with the xc_functional keyword: Local density approximation: LDA LDA-X LDA-C Generalised gradient approximations (GGA): PW91 PBE PBEsol RPBE WC BLYP B86PBE PBE_X PBE_C PBEsol_X PBEsol_C B88_X LYP_C Hybrid (non-local) functionals: HF SHF-LDA PBE0 B3LYP HSE03 HSE06 SPBE0 Meta-GGA functionals: RSCAN MS2 xc_definition The keyword xc_definition in the .param file (used instead of xc_functional) is used when you want to modify the standard behaviour of hybrid functionals, or if you want to construct your own hybrid functionals. The simplest use of xc_definition is to replicate that of xc_functional , for example %block xc_definition PBE 1.0 %endblock xc_definition is the same as xc_functional : PBE The \"1.0\" is what weighted fraction of the functional you want, so in this case 1.0 (i.e. 100% PBE). Recall that hybrids are (usually) a mixture of pure (or screened) non-local Hartree-Fock exchange, some local exchange and local correlation. So you could, for example, build a functional that could be 20% Hartree Fock, 80% LDA exchange and 100% LDA correlation. You can run a Castep calculation with this using %block xc_definition HF 0.2 LDA-X 0.8 LDA-C 1.0 %endblock xc_definition Examples: 1. B3LYP Firstly you cansimply use xc_functional : B3LYP , however B3LYP is a hybrid functional consisting of a mixture of Hartree-Fock, LDA and B88 exchange, LYP and LDA correlation. This functional can be specified component by component: %block xc_definition LDA-X 0.08 B88_X 0.72 LYP_C 0.81 LDA-C 0.19 HF 0.20 %endblock xc_definition Using the full specification in xc_definition makes it straightforward to adjust the various component weightings to your own specification. There are other adjustments that can be made within the functional. For example the popular functional HSE06 contains a screened Hartree-Fock component, with a mixture of other local functionals. It can be specified component by component as %block xc_definition SHF 0.25 PBE 1.0 PBE_X_SR -0.25 NLXC_SCREENING_LENGTH 0.11 NLXC_SCREENING_FUNCTION ERRORFUNCTION %endblock xc_definition In this case we have 25% screened Hartree-Fock offsetting -25% screened PBE exchange (and 100% PBE correlation within PBE). The default HF screening is exponential, but this can be changed to an error function as shown in the block. Also the strength of the screening can be altered by the NLXC_SCREENING_LENGTH parameter (natural units). 2. Hybrid functionals are expensive calculations, much(!) more computationally intensive than (semi-)local functionals. They are often used because they are able to give much better electronic band gaps. If we do LDA and SHF-LDA band structure for silicon we can use the cell file %block lattice_cart 2.7 2.7 0.0 2.7 0.0 2.7 0.0 2.7 2.7 %endblock lattice_cart %block positions_frac Si 0.00 0.00 0.00 Si 0.25 0.25 0.25 %endblock positions_frac symmetry_generate %block spectral_kpoint_path W G X W L G %endblock spectral_kpoint_path %block species_pot NCP %endblock species_pot and then the .param file for LDA task : spectral spectral_task : BandStructure xc_functional : lda and for screened exchange, task : spectral spectral_task : BandStructure xc_functional : shf-lda If we then plot these two band structures together, the difference in results can be seen, the band gap opens from the LDA value of around 0.5eV to a more realistic 1.","title":"Controlling XC"},{"location":"documentation/XC/XCoverview/","text":"There are many sources of description of the role of exchange and correlation within density functional theory, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory Here we will look at how to give both a basic control over the XC functional that your calculation will use and well as giving finer control over functionals that have free parameters.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"documentation/XC/libXC/","text":"There are many (many!) XC functionals (of varying quality and applicability). LIBXC ( https://www.tddft.org/programs/libxc/ ) is a maintained library of functionals that is upgraded regularly. The list of functionals available in LIBXC is at https://www.tddft.org/programs/libxc/functionals/ . Castep interfaces to this library which can be used instead of Castep's in-built library of XC functionals. Prepend the string LIBXC_ to Castep's functional name in the parameter keyword xc_functional to use LIBXC. For example: xc_functional : PBE for Castep's in-built PBE functional xc_functional : LIBXC_PBE for the LIBXC version of the PBE functional In the LIBXC library there are many functionals, covering LDAs, GGAs, Meta-GGAs, Hybrids, etc. Most of these are separated into exchange and correlation contributions. To use these functionals, build your own combination using Castep's xc_definition keyword in the .param file. Firstly at https://www.tddft.org/programs/libxc/functionals/ find the exchange and correlation functionals that you require, note the name LIBXC calls is and then prepend the string LIBXC_ to them. For example to construct Perdew and Zunger's LDA, LDA exchange is called LDA_X and correlation is called LDA_C_PZ. In the .param file use %block xc_definition LIBXC_LDA_X 1.0 LIBXC_LDA_C_PZ 1.0 %endblock xc_definition The \"1.0\" after each is the fraction of how much of each you require to use, in this case 100% of each. Example, construct the PBE functional from LIBXC: In LIBXC, PBE exchange is called GGA_X_PBE and its correlation is called GGA_C_PBE. Prepend with LIBXC_ and construct xc_definition : %block xc_definition LIBXC_GGA_X_PBE 1.0 LIBXC_GGA_C_PBE 1.0 %endblock xc_definition There are a few functional in LIBXC that have combined exchange and correlation parts, so this can be listed in xc_definition on its own. For example the HCTH93 XC functional is called GGA_XC_HCTH_93 in LIBXC hence it can be used in Castep with %block xc_definition LIBXC_GGA_XC_HCTH_93 1.0 %endblock xc_definition LIBXC can also be used to construct hybrid (non-local) functionals that contain (screened) Hartree-Fock components. Note that LIBXC does not contain the non-local part of such functionals, just the local part. Construct the functional using Castep's non-local functionality. For example, the PBE0 functional is called HYB_GGA_XC_PBE0 in LIBXC, so to construct this use %block xc_definition LIBXC_HYB_GGA_XC_PBE0 1.0 HF 0.25 %endblock xc_definition Note here you need to know (ie. read the HYB_GGA_XC_PBE0 reference given in https://www.tddft.org/programs/libxc/functionals/ ) what fraction of local exchange is in the functional and so infer what the fraction of non-local exchange is required (here 0.25). If you want to vary the fraction of non-local exchange then you need to balance this with offsetting it with the correct fraction of local exchange. For this construct the whole functional yourself. For example PBE0 is 0.25HF + 0.75PBE_X + 1.0PBE_C. Varying the HF component in PBE0 can be done with %block xc_definition HF 0.20 LIBXC_GGA_PBE_X 0.80 LIBXC_GGA_PBE_C_1.0 %endblock xc_definition where here it's set to 20% non-local and 80% local exchange, with 100% PBE correlation. Meta-GGAs are also supported. For example the RSCAN functional can be used with %block xc_definition LIBXC_MGGA_X_RSCAN 1.0 LIBXC_MGGA_C_RSCAN 1.0 %endblock xc_definition (although RSCAN is also natively supported in Castep with xc_functional : RSCAN ). The xc_definition keyword in the .param file will allow you to mix and match any of the hundreds of functionals in LIBXC https://www.tddft.org/programs/libxc/functionals/ .

It is directly related to the electron density within the unit cell of a material, n(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) , by a Fourier transformation 1 : F(\\mathbf{H}) = \\mathcal{F}[n(\\mathbf{r})] = \\int_\\textrm{unit cell} n(\\mathbf{r})\\exp(i 2 \\pi \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}) \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}, F(\\mathbf{H}) = \\mathcal{F}[n(\\mathbf{r})] = \\int_\\textrm{unit cell} n(\\mathbf{r})\\exp(i 2 \\pi \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}) \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}, where \\mathbf{H} = h \\mathbf{a}^* + k \\mathbf{b}^* + l\\mathbf{c}^* \\mathbf{H} = h \\mathbf{a}^* + k \\mathbf{b}^* + l\\mathbf{c}^* is the scattering vector corresponding to the (hkl) (hkl) plane, with \\mathbf{a}^*, \\mathbf{b}^* \\mathbf{a}^*, \\mathbf{b}^* and \\mathbf{c}^* \\mathbf{c}^* being the reciprocal lattice vectors of the conventional unit cell. Computation of the SF is difficult within plane-wave pseudopotential DFT codes since the total \"all-electron'' electron density is not normally directly computed and the FFT grids used to house the pseudised valence electron density do not have enough spatial resolution to capture the rapid oscillations near the atomic cores of the total electron density, requiring large plane-wave energy cutoffs in the order of several thousands of eV. Within CASTEP, we have developed an efficient and accurate approach towards calculating these SFs without having to move to large FFT grids or plane-wave energy cutoffs. Details of this implementation can be found in the paper (CITE PAPER WHEN PUBLISHED) but the key observation that has enabled this development is that the electron density can be separated into atom-centred contributions which can be treated on separate radial grids. The resulting structure factor has the form 2 : F(\\mathbf{H}) = \\sum_{j} f_{j} (\\mathbf{H}) \\exp(i 2\\pi \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{j}), F(\\mathbf{H}) = \\sum_{j} f_{j} (\\mathbf{H}) \\exp(i 2\\pi \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{j}), where f_j(\\mathbf{H}) f_j(\\mathbf{H}) is an effective atomic scattering factor of atom j j within the unit cell, defined to be the Fourier transform of its effective atomic density \\rho_j(\\mathbf{r}) \\rho_j(\\mathbf{r}) : f_j (\\mathbf{H}) = \\int \\rho_j (\\mathbf{r}) \\exp(i 2 \\pi \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}) \\mathrm{d}{\\mathbf{r}}. f_j (\\mathbf{H}) = \\int \\rho_j (\\mathbf{r}) \\exp(i 2 \\pi \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}) \\mathrm{d}{\\mathbf{r}}. Incorporating Thermal Effects Within experiments, thermal vibrations (i.e. phonons) can modify the (time-averaged) electron density and, hence, SFs. Making the approximation that the electron density assigned to each atom \\rho_j(\\mathbf{r}) \\rho_j(\\mathbf{r}) directly follows its nuclear motion perfectly, the structure factors can incoporate these thermal vibration effects by including an atomic temperature factor T(\\mathbf{H}) T(\\mathbf{H}) : F(\\mathbf{H}) = \\sum_j T_j(\\mathbf{H}) f_j (\\mathbf{H}) \\exp(i 2 \\pi \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_j). F(\\mathbf{H}) = \\sum_j T_j(\\mathbf{H}) f_j (\\mathbf{H}) \\exp(i 2 \\pi \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_j). Taking the vibrations of an atom to follow that of a harmonic oscillator, the temperature factor can be shown to be of the form: T(\\mathbf{H}) = \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{4} \\mathbf{H}^\\mathbf{T} \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{H} \\right), T(\\mathbf{H}) = \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{4} \\mathbf{H}^\\mathbf{T} \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{H} \\right), where \\mathbf{B}^{jk} = 8 \\pi^2 \\langle u^j u^k \\rangle \\mathbf{B}^{jk} = 8 \\pi^2 \\langle u^j u^k \\rangle \\langle u^j u^k \\rangle \\langle u^j u^k \\rangle are the averaged, squared, thermal displacements of the atom. For the case where the vibrations are isotropic, this equation reduces to: T(\\mathbf{H}) = \\exp \\left(-\\frac{B |\\mathbf{H}|^2}{4} \\right), T(\\mathbf{H}) = \\exp \\left(-\\frac{B |\\mathbf{H}|^2}{4} \\right), where B is termed the Debye-Waller factor. Keywords Currently, to enable CASTEP (versions 21 and beyond) to calculate X-ray SFs, the desired SFs must be placed between CALCULATE_XRD_SF: and :ENDCALCULATE_XRD_SF within the devel_code block of the seed.param file. For example, the (111) (111) and (200) (200) and (220) (220) SFs can be calculated by appending the following code to the end of the seed.param file: %block devel_code CALCULATE_XRD_SF: 1 1 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 :ENDCALCULATE_XRD_SF %endblock devel_code Alternatively, if no structure factors are listed, as in: %block devel_code CALCULATE_XRD_SF: :ENDCALCULATE_XRD_SF %endblock devel_code then the SFs on the entire FFT grid will be written out. Thermal effects can also be incoporated by placing the desired atomic Debye-Waller (DW) factors between DW_FACTOR: and :ENDDW_FACTOR within the devel_code block of the seed.param file.

Computation of the SF is difficult within plane-wave pseudopotential DFT codes since the total \"all-electron'' electron density is not normally directly computed and the FFT grids used to house the pseudised valence electron density do not have enough spatial resolution to capture the rapid oscillations near the atomic cores of the total electron density, requiring large plane-wave energy cutoffs in the order of several thousands of eV. Within CASTEP, we have developed an efficient and accurate approach towards calculating these SFs without having to move to large FFT grids or plane-wave energy cutoffs. Details of this implementation can be found in the paper (CITE PAPER WHEN PUBLISHED) but the key observation that has enabled this development is that the electron density can be separated into atom-centred contributions which can be treated on separate radial grids. The resulting structure factor has the form 2 : F(\\mathbf{H}) = \\sum_{j} f_{j} (\\mathbf{H}) \\exp(i 2\\pi \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{j}), F(\\mathbf{H}) = \\sum_{j} f_{j} (\\mathbf{H}) \\exp(i 2\\pi \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{j}), where f_j(\\mathbf{H}) f_j(\\mathbf{H}) is an effective atomic scattering factor of atom j j within the unit cell, defined to be the Fourier transform of its effective atomic density \\rho_j(\\mathbf{r}) \\rho_j(\\mathbf{r}) : f_j (\\mathbf{H}) = \\int \\rho_j (\\mathbf{r}) \\exp(i 2 \\pi \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}) \\mathrm{d}{\\mathbf{r}}. f_j (\\mathbf{H}) = \\int \\rho_j (\\mathbf{r}) \\exp(i 2 \\pi \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}) \\mathrm{d}{\\mathbf{r}}.","title":"Basic Theory"},{"location":"documentation/XRD/overview/#incorporating-thermal-effects","text":"Within experiments, thermal vibrations (i.e. phonons) can modify the (time-averaged) electron density and, hence, SFs.

Example 1 - Ethanol CH 3 CH 2 OH The discovery that one could actually see chemical shifts in hydrogen spectra was made in 1951 at Stanford University by Packard, Arnold, Dharmatti (shown below). We will try to reproduce this result. Fig1. Proton spectrum of ethanol Files ethanol.cell ethanol.param OBJECTIVES: Examine the convergence of the chemical shieldings with planewave cutoff Compare to experiment. INSTRUCTIONS: Look at the cell and param file. Note that the only special keyword is task = magres. Run castep. Look at the output file. At the end the isotropic chemical shielding, anisotropy, and asymmetry are reported (here we are only interested in the isotropic value.) This information, plus the full tensors is also given in the file ethanol.magres You might wish to transfer the *.magres file back to your desktop to visualise with MagresView Examine the effect of increasing the cutoff energy (say 20-50 Ryd in steps of 10 Ryd). It always helps to plot a graph of the convergence (eg with gnuplot or xmgrace on the cluster - or with excel on the pc) Find the \"converged\" hydrogen (or proton in NMR language) shieldings. We will compare them to experiment. The three methyl (CH3) protons undergo fast exchange; they \"rotate\" faster than the nuclear magnetic moment processes. The magnetic moment will therefore \"see\" an average chemical shielding. The same is true of the CH2 protons. Average the CH 3 and CH 2 chemical shieldings. This will give you 3 unique chemical shieldings. We now need to convert the chemical shieldings \u03c3 iso to chemical shifts \u03b4 iso on the experimental scale. We use the relation: \\delta_{iso}=\\sigma_{ref}-\\sigma_{iso} \\delta_{iso}=\\sigma_{ref}-\\sigma_{iso} , A suitable \u03c3 ref for 1H is 30.97ppm. %block rframe width=200px padding=10px%\\ %width=180px%Attach:nmr_tut2.png Fig1. Proton spectrum of liquid ethanol.%% Fig 2 shows a modern high-resolution 1H spectrum for liquid ethanol. Note that the peaks are split due to J-coupling - the interaction of the 1H magnetic moments - but let's ignore that for now. The three peaks are roughly at 1.2ppm, 3.7ppm and 5ppm. You should find that your computed values agree for two sites. Do you know why the other site has such a large disagreement with experiment? Example 2 - Diamond FILES: *diamond.cell *diamond.param OBJECTIVES: * Examine the convergence of the chemical shielding as the sampling of the electronic Brillouin zone (BZ) is increased. INSTRUCTIONS: * Look at the files diamond.cell and diamond.param * We have specified the kpoints in the cell file using the keyword kpoints_mp_grid 4 4 4 * Run CASTEP for a range of kpoint meshes (say 2,4,6,8,10) * Examine (plot?) the convergence of the chemical shielding. The computational cost scales linearly with the number of kpoints (ie the number of points in the irreducible Brillouin Zone). For a large unit cell (ie a small BZ) it may be possible to get converged results using a single k-point. But which kpoint should we choose? For diamond we will look at 3 different k-points (0,0,0), (\u00bd,\u00bd,\u00bd) (\u00bc,\u00bc,\u00bc). Specify the kpoint in the cell file using %BLOCK KPOINTS_LIST 0.25 0.25 0.25 1.0 %ENDBLOCK KPOINTS_LIST Which gives a result closest to the converged answer? (as the diamond unit cell is rather small the 1 kpoint answer is not too close to converged. However, the observation holds true for all orthorhombic cells) PART 3 We now look at some more realistic examples. Oxygen-17 Oxygen is a component of many geological materials. Oxygen is also important element in organic and biological molecules since it is often intimately involved in hydrogen bonding. Solid State 17 O NMR should be a uniquely valuable probe as the chemical shift range of 17 O covers almost 1000 ppm in organic molecules. Furthermore 17 O has spin I = 5/2 and hence a net quadrupole moment. As a consequence of this the solid state NMR spectrum is strongly affected by the electric field gradient at the nucleus. Because the isotopic abundance of 17 O is very low (0.037%) and the NMR linewidths due to the electric field gradient relatively large, only limited Solid State NMR data is available. This is particularly true for organic materials. First principles calculations of 17 O NMR parameters have played a vital role in assigning experimental spectra, and developing empirical rules between NMR parameters and local atomic structure. Example 3 - Alanine, a simple amino acid FILES: *alanine.cell *alanine.param *alanine.pdb OBJECTIVES: Compute the chemical shift and Electric field gradient for alanine Assign the 17 NMR spectrum %block rframe width=200px padding=10px%\\ %width=180px%Attach:nmr_tut3.png Fig3.

It always helps to plot a graph of the convergence (eg with gnuplot or xmgrace on the cluster - or with excel on the pc) Find the \"converged\" hydrogen (or proton in NMR language) shieldings. We will compare them to experiment. The three methyl (CH3) protons undergo fast exchange; they \"rotate\" faster than the nuclear magnetic moment processes. The magnetic moment will therefore \"see\" an average chemical shielding. The same is true of the CH2 protons. Average the CH 3 and CH 2 chemical shieldings. This will give you 3 unique chemical shieldings. We now need to convert the chemical shieldings \u03c3 iso to chemical shifts \u03b4 iso on the experimental scale.

Oxygen is also important element in organic and biological molecules since it is often intimately involved in hydrogen bonding. Solid State 17 O NMR should be a uniquely valuable probe as the chemical shift range of 17 O covers almost 1000 ppm in organic molecules. Furthermore 17 O has spin I = 5/2 and hence a net quadrupole moment. As a consequence of this the solid state NMR spectrum is strongly affected by the electric field gradient at the nucleus. Because the isotopic abundance of 17 O is very low (0.037%) and the NMR linewidths due to the electric field gradient relatively large, only limited Solid State NMR data is available. This is particularly true for organic materials. First principles calculations of 17 O NMR parameters have played a vital role in assigning experimental spectra, and developing empirical rules between NMR parameters and local atomic structure.","title":"Oxygen-17"},{"location":"tutorials/NMR/NMR_shielding/#example-3-alanine-a-simple-amino-acid","text":"FILES: *alanine.cell *alanine.param *alanine.pdb OBJECTIVES: Compute the chemical shift and Electric field gradient for alanine Assign the 17 NMR spectrum %block rframe width=200px padding=10px%\\ %width=180px%Attach:nmr_tut3.png Fig3.
