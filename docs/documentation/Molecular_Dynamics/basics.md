Fundamental to MD calculations is the calculation time-step. An appropriate value
for the simulation should be specified in the parameters file in the following way.

```
md_delta_t  = 2 fs
```

Any valid unit of time can be used when specifying the time-step. The number of
time-steps to perform is specified with e.g.

```
md_num_iter = 500
```
NB This is the number of steps to be calculated in this run. It is NOT the accumulated total number of steps in a series of 
continuation runs. The "MD time" value in the `<seed>.castep` file records the cumulative time.

##Ensembles

The following statistical ensembles can be simulated using CASTEP.

####NVE

In this ensemble the number of atoms (N), the shape
and volume (V) of the simulation cell and the energy (E) remain constant. The conserved energy is the Born-Oppenheimer
Hamiltonian

$$E = \left<\Psi|\hat{H}_{e}|\Psi\right> + \frac{1}{2}
\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\frac{Z_{i}Z_{j}}
{|\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}|}
+\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{P_{i}^{2}}{2M_{i}}$$

in atomic units.

This ensemble is selected using the command

```
md_ensemble  =  NVE
```

in the parameters file. The actual value of the conserved energy
will be the result of the initial self-consistent DFT calculation plus
the kinetic energy of the initial ionic velocities.

These ionic velocities are defined in one of three ways.


* By explicit user definition of ionic velocities in the cell file, e.g.
```
%BLOCK IONIC_VELOCITIES
auv                    
H  xxxxx yyyyy zzzzz
H  xxxxx yyyyy zzzzz
O  xxxxx yyyyy zzzzz
%ENDBLOCK IONIC_VELOCITIES
```
using any valid unit of velocity (auv is atomic unit of velocity), etc.

* By definition of an initial temperature in the parameters file, e.g.
```
md_temperature  =  293 K
```
Note that this can be specified using any valid unit
of temperature. In this case initial velocities are assigned randomly
such that the total linear momentum is zero and the instantaneous
temperature matches that specified. The system will reach
equilibrium with a somewhat different temperature due to equipartition of kinetic and potential energy.


* By continuation from an equilibrated run at the desired temperature. This
could be a run in any of the other available ensembles. This will also use the
cell and ionic positions from the continuation file. See the section on
continuation for details.

Velocities read from a continuation file will always take precedence. If no
continuation file is used, and both `md_temperature` and an `IONIC_VELOCITIES`
block are specified, the `md_temperature` keyword will be ignored.

By default, pressure is not calculated during an NVE run. To override this
use the command

```
calculate_stress = true
```

in the parameters file.

####NVT

This ensemble is selected with

```
md_ensemble  =  NVT
```

The system will be evolved to a specific temperature defined using
the ``md_temperature`` keyword as used above. Initial velocities
are assigned based on this temperature, read from an ``IONIC_VELOCITIES``
block in the cell file, or read from a continuation file in the same way as
above.

Temperature control can be implemented by one of several methods, all
of which have been shown to correctly sample the canonical ensemble. The
first of these is the deterministic Nose-Hoover chain method of Tuckerman et al [^1]  and is selected with

```
md_thermostat  =  nose-hoover
```

in the parameters file. In the NVT case, a single Nose-Hoover chain
is coupled to all particle degrees of freedom. The length of the
chain can also be specified, e.g.

```
md_nhc_length  =  5
```

for a chain of five thermostats. 

In the Nose-Hoover case with a chain of $M$ thermostats acting of $N_{f}$ ionic degrees of freedom, the conserved quantity 
is the pseudo-Hamiltonian

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H} = \left<\Psi|\hat{H}_{e}|\Psi\right> + \frac{1}{2}
\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\frac{Z_{i}Z_{j}}
{|\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}|}
+\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{P_{i}^{2}}{2M_{i}}
+ \sum_{i=1}^{M}\frac{p_{\xi_{i}}^{2}}{2Q_{i}}
+ N_{f}k_{B}T\xi_{1} + k_{B}T\sum_{i=2}^{M}\xi_{i}
\end{equation}

where the $Q_{i}$ are the thermostat fictitious masses assigned automatically
from the specified ion relaxation time and $\xi_{i}$ are the thermostat degrees of
freedom. This is printed with the label
``Hamilt    Energy:``  at each time-step. A Nose-Hoover thermostat with no chain (i.e. with $M$=1 ) is known to not be 
ergodic and hence should be avoided. 

The second method of controlling temperature is through the stochastic Langevin thermostat.

```
md_thermostat = langevin
```

In this case the printed Hamiltonian energy is the value of
equation above. This is not conserved by the dynamics, but should
exhibit no long term drift from the equilibrium value.

Finally, the temperature may be controled via the Hoover-Langevin thermostat.

```
md_thermostat = hoover-langevin
```
which is the fusion of a deterministic Nose-Hoover thermostat acting directly on the physical system, with a Langevin 
thermostat operating on the Nose-Hoover variables, in order to guarantee ergodicity.

With each method, a suitable relaxation time for the thermostatic
process should be specified. This can use any supported unit of
time, e.g

```
md_ion_t = 2.4 ps
```

for a thermostat relaxation time of 2.4 picoseconds. The Hoover-Langevin thermostat is the LEAST sensitive to the choice of 
this value.

As with the NVE ensemble, pressure is not calculated by default. This is
overridden in the same way as the NVE case.

####NPH

In this ensemble the size and (if desired) shape of the simulation
cell varies to regulate pressure. No thermostat is applied and hence the enthalpy (H) is conserved.

This ensemble is specified with the following:

```
md_ensemble = NPH
```

The external pressure is set in the cell definition file using
any valid unit of pressure. The required symmetry of the external pressure
tensor implies that only the upper triangular components need be
specified, e.g.

```
     %block external_pressure
     GPa
     0.5   0.0  0.0
           0.5  0.0
                0.5
     %endblock external_pressure
```

to specify an isotropic external pressure of 0.5 Giga-Pascals. MD can also support non-isotropic pressure if using a 
variable-shape barostat.

Velocities are assigned such that the initial temperature is equal
to ``md_temperature``, or are read from the cell definition
file/continuation file as in the NVE/NVT cases.

Two barostat schemes are available. The first restricts the dynamics
of the cell to isotropic expansions and contractions. This
follows the method of Andersen[^4] and Hoover[^2] [^3] as corrected
by Martyna et al.[^5]. This is selected using:

```
md_barostat = andersen-hoover
```

In this case the printed Hamiltonian energy is the enthalpy, plus the kinetic
energy associated with the cell motion.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:AndersenNPH}
H = \left<\Psi|\hat{H}_{e}|\Psi\right> + \frac{1}{2}
\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\frac{Z_{i}Z_{j}}
{|\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}|}
+\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{P_{i}^{2}}{2M_{i}} + P_{ext}V + p_{\epsilon}^{2}/2W
\end{equation}

The alternative scheme implements the method of Parrinello and Rahman[^6] [^7].
Both the size and shape of the simulation cell are allowed to vary. The issue of
cell rotations is eliminated by the use of a symmetrised pressure tensor. Note that
as liquids cannot sustain shear, this method should only be used with solids.
It should also be noted that this scheme is based on the modified Parrinello-Rahman method
of Martyna, Tobias and Klien[^5].

The following line in the parameters file selects this barostat.


```
md_barostat = parrinello-rahman
```

The cell dynamics contain nine degrees of freedom (of which six are independent) leading to
a Hamiltonian energy of

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ParRarNPH}
H = \left<\Psi|\hat{H}_{e}|\Psi\right> + \frac{1}{2}
\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\frac{Z_{i}Z_{j}}
{|\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}|}
+\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{P_{i}^{2}}{2M_{i}} + P_{ext}V + \mathrm{Tr}[{\mathbf{p}_{g}\mathbf{p}_{g}^{T}]}/2W
\end{equation}

For both barostats, a relaxation time for the cell motions should be specified
with an appropriate unit of time, for example:

```
md_cell_t = 20 ps
```

This time is used to calculate a fictitious mass $W$ for the cell dynamics and should be large compared to the 
characteristic time for the ionic dynamics.

The NPH equations of motion require that pressure (stress) is calculated at each
MD time-step. The value of ``calculate_stress`` is therefore irrelevant
in this case.

A variable cell implies variable reciprocal lattice vectors
which has consequences for the plane-wave basis set. As the cell changes,
the number of plane waves required to produce the specified cut-off energy
changes.

The user therefore has two options. The first is to fix the size
of the basis set.

```
fixed_npw = true
```

The cut-off energy is now variable as is the quality of the
basis set. This option should therefore only be used for calculations
in which the volume changes are small and which are over-converged
with respect to the number of plane waves.

The second option is to allow the basis set to change at each time-step.

```
fixed_npw = false
```
which is the default value. This keeps the cut-off energy approximately constant by adding
or subtracting plane waves from the basis set at each time-step.

In either case, the effect of Pulay stress is reduced
by applying a finite basis set correction to the pressure
at each time-step. In the case of a fixed number of plane waves, the
constant correction to energy is ignored. With variable number
of plane waves the energy correction is no longer constant
and is recalculated at each step.


####NPT

The NPT ensemble is specified with the command:

```
md_ensemble = NPT
```

This can use either the Nose-Hoover or Langevin thermostat, and either Andersen-Hoover or Parrinello-Rahman barostat. In 
all cases, the dynamics can be shown to correctly sample the isothermal-isobaric ensemble[^5]

All options pertaining to the NPH and NVT ensembles apply.

In the case of Langevin dynamics at NPT, the printed Hamiltonian energy is
the same as in the NPH ensemble, i.e. that given by the equations above. In the case of Nose-Hoover NPT molecular dynamics, 
the Hamiltonian energy is given by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:HooverNPT}
H = \left<\Psi|\hat{H}_{e}|\Psi\right> + \frac{1}{2}
\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\frac{Z_{i}Z_{j}}
{|\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}|}
+\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{P_{i}^{2}}{2M_{i}} + P_{ext}V + p_{\epsilon}^{2}/2W
+ \sum_{i=1}^{M}\frac{p_{\xi_{i}}^{2}}{2Q_{i}}
+ N_{f}k_{B}T\xi_{1} + k_{B}T\sum_{i=2}^{M}\xi_{i}
+ \sum_{i=1}^{M}\frac{p_{\xi_{bi}}^{2}}{2Q_{bi}}
+ k_{B}T\sum_{i=1}^{M}\xi_{bi}
\end{equation}

in the case of isotropic cell dynamics, or

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ParRarNPT}
H = \left<\Psi|\hat{H}_{e}|\Psi\right> + \frac{1}{2}
\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\frac{Z_{i}Z_{j}}
{|\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}|}
+\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{P_{i}^{2}}{2M_{i}} + P_{ext}V + \mathrm{Tr}[{\mathbf{p}_{g}\mathbf{p}_{g}^{T}]}/2W
+ \sum_{i=1}^{M}\frac{p_{\xi_{i}}^{2}}{2Q_{i}}
+ N_{f}k_{B}T\xi_{1} + k_{B}T\sum_{i=2}^{M}\xi_{i}
+ \sum_{i=1}^{M}\frac{p_{\xi_{bi}}^{2}}{2Q_{bi}}
+ 9k_{B}T\xi_{b1} + k_{B}T\sum_{i=2}^{M}\xi_{bi}
\end{equation}

in the Parrinello-Rahman case. Note that in each case the motion of the cell degree(s) of
freedom couple to a second Nose-Hoover chain.
